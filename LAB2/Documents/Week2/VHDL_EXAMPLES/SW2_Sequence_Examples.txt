SEQUENCE OF EXAMPLES
============================

1)  COUNT_DOWN.VHD 
	- warmup from week-1
	- counter with control inputs & parameters (via generic)
	- Q: which other value, would you also declare as generic?

	
2)  ALARM_LEVEL_DISPLAY_WO_DEFAULT.VHD 
	- priority in combinational processes
	- Q: what would you improve/change in this code?

	
3)  ALARM_LEVEL_DISPLAY.VHD
	- default statements inside processes 
	  (possible with sequential statements)
	- identify most common assignments
	- Q: what happens with missing default 
	     (or incomplete assignment in comb-logic)

		 
3)  HEX2SEVSEG_W_CONTROL.VHD
	- comb logic with nested IF/THEN & CASE/WHEN
	- Q: draw & fill out truth table
	- Q: how could change block to use only once NOT()

	
4)  SHIFTREG_P2S.VHD
	- example of shiftregister circuit
	- Comment: applications of shiftregisters
	- Exercise: pseudo-random-register (PRG)
	- Q: implement PRG with sequence length of (2^4)-1
	- Q: implement PRG with sequence length of (2^128)-1
	- Q: how would you initialise your PRG?

	
5)  SYNC_N_EDGEDETECTOR.VHD
	- why synchronise external inputs /or/ inputs different clock domains
	- avoid metastability
	- Q: Draw the RTL-diagram (RTL analysis) / timing diagram =>as homework

	
6)  FSM_EXAMPLE.VHD
	- example for enumerated datatype declaration
	  and fsm implementation syntax with CASE/WHEN
	- Q: draw bubble diagram

	
7)  FSM_EXERCISE.VHD
	- example of 2 RTL structures in a single file
	- Q: draw bubble- and RTL-diagram
	- Q: understand functioning. 
	For example, what is max interval between take_1 and take_2 to be
	able to achieve state count_down?
