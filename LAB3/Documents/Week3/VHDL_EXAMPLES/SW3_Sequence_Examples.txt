SEQUENCE OF EXAMPLES
============================

1)  SIMPLE_DFF_CIRC.VHD 
	- recall from week-1 to use in testbench example

	
2)  TESTBENCH_SIMPLE_DFF_CIRC.VHD 
	Example for testbench. Check for new elements:
	- COMPONENT DECLARATION		(needed for hierarchical VHDL)
	- INSTATIATION				(needed for hierarchical VHDL)
	- CLOCK_GEN PROCESS			(typical for testbench)
	- STIMULI PROCESS			(typical for testbench)
	- WAIT-FOR/-UNTIL STATEMENT	(non synthesisable VHDL)
	- ASSERT/REPORT/SEVERITY	(non synthesisable VHDL)
	
	Vocabulary:
	- DUT: device under test
	- Behavioural VHDL : non synthesisable code
	
	- Q: draw corresponding timing diagram

	
	
3)  COMPILE.DO
	Script to start the ModelSim simulation. Attention:
	- relative paths to source files
	- vsim command calls testbench entity name
	- requires waveform file wave*.do
	
	
		 
4)  TESTBENCH_UART_RX_ONLY_TOP.VHD
	Check for new elements:
	- Syntax for internal probes (TB has access to signals within hierarchy)
	- REPORT STATEMENT		(non synthesisable VHDL)
	- FOR/LOOP STATEMENT
